# Clutter-pong

The classic arcade game PONG implemented with [Clutter](http://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/) using its javascript bindings.

Disclaimer: This is my first attempt of writing a game and my first program with Clutter.

## Usage

Hopefully you have a GNOME 3 environment and a gjs-console installed.

```bash
$ cd src/
$ gjs-console main.js
```

Player 1 moves up and down with keys *W* and *S*.
Player 2 moves up and down with keys *I* and *K*.


## TODO

* More control on the ball reflection by the player
* Variable speed (tunelling in any speed not multiple of 5)
* Clean and clean code and design
* Add sounds
